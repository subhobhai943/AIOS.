| AI Integration (Local Inference) | ⬜ Not Started |

## Phase 1 — The Foundation (Boot & Architecture)

**Goal:** Transition the CPU from legacy 16-bit mode to modern 64-bit Long Mode and establish a minimal execution environment.

### 1.1 — Toolchain & Environment

- Build `x86_64-elf` cross-compiler (GCC/Binutils) to target bare metal
- Configure QEMU emulator for rapid testing & debugging
- Set up `gdb` debugging scripts for real-time CPU state inspection
- Create build system (Makefile/CMake) to link Assembly and C code

### 1.2 — Bootloader Mechanics

- Write Stage 1 Bootloader (MBR) in Assembly (fits in 512 bytes)
- Implement BIOS interrupts for basic disk reading
- Enable the A20 Line to access high memory
- Switch CPU from 16-bit Real Mode → 32-bit Protected Mode
- **Advanced:** Setup Paging Tables (PML4) to switch into 64-bit Long Mode

### 1.3 — Kernel Entry

- Write `kernel_entry.asm` (stack setup, GDT loading)
- Link assembly entry point to C `kernel_main()` function
- Implement Basic VGA Text Driver (writing directly to `0xB8000` memory)
- Handle CPU exceptions (Double Fault, General Protection Fault)

> **Exit criteria:** OS boots from a `.iso`/`.img` file, switches to 64-bit mode, and prints `"AIOS Initialized"` to the screen without crashing.

---

## Phase 2 — Core Kernel Systems

**Goal:** Establish the "nervous system" of the OS—handling memory, interrupts, and basic hardware interaction.

### 2.1 — Memory Management (The Sandbox)

- Detect available physical memory (via Multiboot2 info or BIOS)
- Implement Physical Memory Manager (Bitmap Allocator)
- Implement Virtual Memory Manager (Paging, 4KB & 2MB pages)
- Write Kernel Heap Allocator (`kmalloc` / `kfree`)
- **AIOS Specific:** Implement "Tensor Allocator" for contiguous memory blocks (essential for Matrix operations)

### 2.2 — Interrupts & Hardware

- Remap PIC (Programmable Interrupt Controller)
- Set up IDT (Interrupt Descriptor Table) with ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines)
- Write PS/2 Keyboard Driver (Scan code to ASCII mapping)
- Configure PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) for system clock
- **AIOS Specific:** Setup APIC (Advanced PIC) for Multi-Core support (SMP) for parallel AI tasks

### 2.3 — Basic Drivers

- PCI Enumeration (scanning hardware bus)
- Basic Disk Driver (AHCI SATA or IDE) to read sectors
- Serial Port Driver (for logging/debugging without screen)

> **Exit criteria:** Kernel successfully allocates memory, handles keyboard input, and manages system time.

---

## Phase 3 — Storage & Filesystem

**Goal:** Create a system to store and retrieve the massive binary weight files required by AI models.

### 3.1 — Filesystem Implementation

- Implement a simple filesystem driver (FAT16/32 or custom "AI-FS")
- Write `open`, `read`, `write`, `close` system call implementations
- Create a Virtual File System (VFS) layer for abstraction
- **AIOS Specific:** Design "Tensor Partition" format for streaming large model weights directly into RAM

### 3.2 — Persistence

- Write MBR partition table to disk image
- Implement file ownership and basic metadata
- Create a basic shell command to list files (`ls` equivalent)

> **Exit criteria:** OS can read a file from the disk and load it into memory.

---

## Phase 4 — Multitasking & Scheduling

**Goal:** Enable the OS to manage multiple processes—crucial for running the AI engine alongside the UI.

### 4.1 — Process Management

- Define Process Control Block (PCB) structure
- Implement Context Switching (saving/restoring registers)
- Write a Round-Robin Scheduler
- Implement Kernel Threads (for background tasks)

### 4.2 — User Space & Safety

- Implement Ring 3 (User Mode) switching
- Setup TSS (Task State Segment) for privilege switching
- Implement System Calls (Software Interrupts or `SYSCALL` instruction)
- **AIOS Specific:** Create `sys_run_inference` system call

### 4.3 — The "Intelligent" Scheduler

- **AIOS Specific:** Implement Priority Queue for responsiveness
- **AIOS Specific:** Detect heavy compute tasks (Matrix Mult) and schedule efficiently (prevent UI freeze during LLM thinking)

> **Exit criteria:** OS can run multiple programs simultaneously and switch between them smoothly.

---

## Phase 5 — The AI Layer (The Brain)

**Goal:** Integrate the math engine and local LLM architecture directly into the kernel space.

### 5.1 — High-Performance Math

- Enable FPU/SSE/AVX states in Context Switching
- Write Matrix Multiplication kernel in Assembly (using AVX2/AVX-512)
- Implement `matmul`, `vector_add`, `softmax` functions in Kernel Space
- **AIOS Specific:** Optimize memory layout for cache locality (Cache Blocking)

### 5.2 — Inference Engine

- Port a tokenizer (BPE/Unigram) implementation to C (no stdlib)
- Write a parser for model weight files (e.g., GGUF or SafeTensors format)
- Implement the Transformer architecture (Attention, Feed Forward, Normalization)
- **AIOS Specific:** Load a small pre-trained model (e.g., TinyLlama or a small RNN) into kernel memory

### 5.3 — Local LLM Integration

- Create the AI Interface: `aios_query(prompt_buffer, output_buffer)`
- Implement "Token Streaming" output (OS prints tokens as they generate)
- Verify local inference runs entirely offline (no internet calls)

> **Exit criteria:** The OS can load a model file and generate text locally using native CPU instructions.

---

## Phase 6 — User Interface & Shell

**Goal:** Create the human-computer interface where the user interacts with the local LLM.

### 6.1 — Graphical Interface

- Request Linear Frame Buffer (LFB) from bootloader (GUI mode)
- Write basic graphics driver (draw pixel, line, rectangle)
- Implement bitmap font rendering (text on graphics mode)

### 6.2 — The NLP Shell

- Build a command-line interface on top of graphics driver
- Implement text input buffer and cursor
- **AIOS Specific:** Route user commands through the local LLM
- **AIOS Specific:** Implement intent parsing: `"Open file X"` → LLM → System Call `open("X")`

> **Exit criteria:** A graphical or text-based terminal where the user can chat with the OS to execute commands.
